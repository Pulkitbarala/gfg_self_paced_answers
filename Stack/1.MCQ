QUESTION 1
Consider n elements that are equally distributed in k stacks. In each stack, elements of it are arranged in ascending order (min is at the top in each of the stack and then increasing downwards).
Given a queue of size n in which we have to put all n elements in increasing order. What will be the time complexity of the best known algorithm?

Ans - O(n logk)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 2
Consider the following statements:
i.   First-in-first out types of computations are efficiently supported by STACKS.
ii.  Implementing LISTS on linked lists is more efficient than implementing LISTS on an array for almost all the basic LIST operations.
iii. Implementing QUEUES on a circular array is more efficient than implementing QUEUES on a linear array with two indices.
iv.  Last-in-first-out type of computations are efficiently supported by QUEUES.
Which of the following is correct?

Ans - 
(iii) is true

QUESTION 3
Which of the following permutation can be obtained in the same order using a stack assuming that input is the sequence 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in that order?

Ans - 
7, 8, 9, 6, 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 4

Ans - 
2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 5

Ans - 
Stack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 6
What is the time complexity of the push and pop operations in a stack implemented using an array?

Ans - 
O(1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 7
The seven elements A, B, C, D, E, F and G are pushed onto a stack in reverse order, i.e., starting from G. The stack is popped five times and each element is inserted into a queue.Two elements are deleted from the queue and pushed back onto the stack. Now, one element is popped from the stack. The popped item is ________.

Ans - 
B
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 8
The five items: A, B, C, D, and E are pushed in a stack, one after other starting from A. The stack is popped four items and each element is inserted in a queue. The two elements are deleted from the queue and pushed back on the stack. Now one item is popped from the stack. The popped item is

Ans - 
D
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 9
Stack A has the entries a, b, c (with a on top). Stack B is empty. An entry popped out of stack A can be printed immediately or pushed to stack B. An entry popped out of the stack B can be only be printed. In this arrangement, which of the following permutations of a, b, c are not possible?

Ans - 
c a b
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION 10
Which operation is performed on the top of the stack when implementing the undo feature in a text editor?

Ans - 
Pop
